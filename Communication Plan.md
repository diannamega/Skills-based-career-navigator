# Communication Plan

To foster effective collaboration and communication, we plan to implement a multi-faceted approach. We will hold two formal Zoom meetings per week on weekdays at 6:00 PM PST to accommodate our time zone differences, ensuring dedicated time for synchronous discussion and collaborative work. A brief check-in will be scheduled on Saturdays to maintain momentum, with final reviews conducted on Sundays. For quick questions and informal discussions, we will utilize iMessage, while longer discussions and document reviews will be conducted via email. This combination of scheduled meetings and flexible communication channels will ensure consistent interaction and facilitate efficient progress throughout the project.

# GitHub Use

Team members will commit to the same branch and use pull request to update all information throughout the project.


Just adding something to show that we changed something - ignore.
