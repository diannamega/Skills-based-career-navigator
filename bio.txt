I am a 32 year old engineering professional, lifelong student, and mom to two little boys.
I work for Duke Energy in North Carolina in their distribution engineering department.
In my free time I like to fish and paddleboard with my family, and work in my garden.
I am also an avid reader and am currently working my way through my 50 book goal for 2025.
